# SurvMODE

This repository contains R and Julia code used in the two case studies of the manuscript:

> Christen, J.A. and Rubio, F.J. (2025). Hazard-based distributional regression via ordinary differential equations. Submitted.

1. The `R code` folder contains the R code used in the first case study. In particular, the file `Example1_2A.html` provides a tutorial that demonstrates the R code and corresponding outputs for this example.
2. The `Julia code` folder contains the Julia code used in the second case study. This code can be used for model building and posterior sampling. In particular, the file `rotterdamJulia.html` provides a tutorial that demonstrates the Julia code and corresponding outputs for this example.
